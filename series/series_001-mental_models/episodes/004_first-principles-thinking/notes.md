3. What are some other techniques?
4. What are some examples of FPT?

## What is first principles thinking?
* background: constrast to reasoning by analogy
    * understanding one thing in terms of a similar thing
* tool to help clarify complicated problems
* a way to blow past inaccurate assumptions
* method to reevaluate and improve something
    * to improve something, we need to understand why it is successful or not.
* a way to step outside history/conventional wisdom and see what's possible.
* a filter: separates underlying ideas/facts from assumptions based off them
* a search: 
    * for the foundational knowledge that will not change
    * search for the axioms off of which we can build everything else.
* an identifier:
    * Which elements are, in the given context, non-reducible.
* Take apart something; test assumptions; reconstruct.
* Are they constant?
    * No: they update depending on context.

## What are the two main techniques for FP thinking?
* Everything that is not a law of nature is a shared belief. Money, Borders, Bitcoin, Love.
* 1) Socratic Questioning:
    * Clarify thinking and explain origins of your ideas. (What exactly do I think? Why do I think it?)
    * Challenge assumptions. (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite were true?)
    * Looking for evidence. (How can I back this up?)
    * Considering alternative perspectives (what might others think? How do I know I am correct?)
    * Examining consequences/implications. (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences?)
    * Questioning the original questions. (Why did I think that? Was I correct?)
* 2) The Five Whys:
    * goal: land on a what or a how, probe the limits of knowledge/understanding.
    * ask why until you land on a falsifiable fact, a what/how.

## What are some other techniques?
* Elon Musk 3-Step Method:
    * Identify and define current assumptions
    * Breakdown the problem into its fundamental principles
    * Create new solutions from scratch
* Elon example:
    * Battery packs are $600 per kw hr
    * FPT:
        * What are the material constituents of batteries?
        * What is the market value of the constituents? (nickel, cobalt, carbon, etc.)
        * If we bought those what would it cost? ans: ~$80.
* Cartesian Doubt: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_doubt)
    * systematic process of being skeptical about (or doubting) ones beliefs
    * technique:
        * accept only information you know is true.
        * break down these truths into smaller units.
        * 

## What are some examples?
* sterile stomach:
    * scientists thought that bacteria could not grow in stomach due to acidity.
    * stomach ulcers can be treated with antibiotics.
    * result: sterile stomach was not a first principles.
* curved chattle shute:
    * reducing stress in animals
    * what are the first principles of meat?
        * FP: scent and taste; (also texture and use in cooking)
        * not FP: once being part of an animal
