# The Map is not the Territory

* source: Great mental models Vol. 1 - Shane Parrish

* A map can also be thought of as a model of something, of reality.
* The map of reality is not reality. Maps are imperfect, reductions of what they represent.
* If a map perfectly represented the territory it would no longer be useful, it would be too complex.
* Map's usefulness == its reduction
* A Map can be a snapshot in time, something which no longer exist.
* GOAL: distill complexity into something simple.


## Examples of Maps
* Navigating from one city to another.
    * How far away are things?
    * What is along my trajectory? (gas, food, landmarks/sights)
* The financial statements of a company => how is the company performing in the market?
* An appliance manual => how the appliance works? How to fix and resolve issues problems?

## Usefulness
* Maps/Models are flawed, but this is no excuse to ignore them, why?
    * They are useful, useful to the extent that they can:
        * explain i.e. aid in understanding
        * predict
        * give new previously unknown insights
        * increase effeciency / decrease errors towards achieving defined goals (relevant to the map)

## Origin: Alfred Korzybski
* Phrase and Paper coined by Korzybski in 1931.
* [Summary of Paper](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/the-map-is-not-the-territory)
* London underground map => useful to travelers, train drivers don't use it.
    * 1. Maps/Models describe a territory but in a useful way w/a specific purpose.
    * 2. The ideal map would contain the map of the map, recursively, self-reflexivity
        * Ex: guide to paris, guide to the guide to paris, etc. (You would have answers to all problems, but complexity would become overwhelming)
    * Key points:
        * Altering the map does not change the territory. 
            * If you change what you believe about an object, patterns of neurons will change but not the object.
            * Ex: you can believe gravity doesn't exists or that you can fly. You will still not be able to fly though.
        * The map is a separate object from the territory AND exists as an object inside the territory.
            * Ex: we cause things to happen which cause other things AND things have caused us, even sometimes the things we cause (in feedback loops).
    * Associated Fallacy: [Mind Projection Fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/mind-projection-fallacy)
        * Projecting properties of your own mind onto the external world.
        * Ex:
            * when I look at a rock, I do not experience the rock only my minds representation of the rock.
            * Sugar is not inherently sweet, it only has chemical properties, which the brain interprets / represents as sweet.
        
* We can only navigate the complexity of reality through abstraction.
* Ex News: 
    * we read news. Journalists have consumed vast amounts of info, reflected on it, drawn abstractions and conclusions.
    * a lot is lost in the process.
    * its hard to see when the map no longer agrees w/the territory.

* We can forget the territory contains details the map doesn't describe.
* Problem: mistaking the map for reality => we think we have all the answers.
    * We create static rules and forget we live in a constantly changing world.
    * ignoring feedback loops => not seeing when the terrain has changed + reducing our ability to adapt to a changing environment.
* Maps as dogma => maps/models are not meant to be static references, the world is dynamic and constantly changing.
* Map/Models value = ability to predict/explain.
    * Therefore, as reality changes map/model must change to reflect reality.
    * Ex: Newtonian Physics worked until Einstein with special realitivity in 1905 produced a more accurate model.
    * Physicists delimit what Newton's and Einstein's models can explain/predict.
    * When they hit uncharted territory they don't assume the models work but proceede carefully.
* Problem: Risks of the territory not being shown on the map.
    * We must know the limitations, what it does and what it does not tell us. If we don't, danger lurks.

## Tragedy of the Commons
* What is common to many is taken less care of, for all men have greater regard for what is their own than for what they possess in common with others - Aristotle.
* A shared resource can be destroyed through bad incentives.
* Parable: why common resources get used more than is desireable from the standpoint of society as a whole.
* Garrett Hardin wrote extensively about the concept. [Article](https://pages.mtu.edu/~asmayer/rural_sustain/governance/Hardin%201968.pdf)
* Idea: Herdsman on public pastures.
    * Utility of adding one animal:
        * positive: sale of additional animal, say +1 in utility
        * negative: overgrazing of land, effects shared by all heardsmen, therefore utility is a fraction of -1, say (-1/10) if there are ten herdsmen.
        * The rational herdsman concludes he should add another animal, and another, and another.
        * Every heardsman reaches the same conclusion, increases heard w/out limit.
        * Resources are limited => ruin and doom comes, freedom in commons brings ruin to all.

### Issues
* Problem 1: We could assume that if the territory matches the map/model in some respects it matches in all respects.
* Ex: maybe emperically the shared resource is not destroyed and people behave differently.
* Problem 2: We could think adherence to map is more important than taking in new information about the territory.
* Maps are tools for thinking, not doctrines to force conformity, guidebooks not laws.

* George Box: All models are wrong, the practical question is: how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.

## Using a Map/Model

### Things to consider
1. Reality is the ultimate updater
2. Consider the cartographer.
3. Maps can influence territories.

#### Reality is ultimate update
* maps are good for: Traveling to a new city, having a first child, starting a new job,
    * But the territory (cities, child, new job), changes and we should update map/models based on experience/feedback.
* Ex: Stereotypes
    * Can be useful to process large amounts of information
    * Problem: when we forget the territory is much more complex, stereotype != territory.
* Maps capture a territory at a specific point in time.
    * A map may have done a good job at depicting what was != does good job at depicting what is.
    * The faster the rate of change of the territory the harder it is for the map to keep up.

#### Consider the cartographer
* maps are not objective creations.
    * Reflect the values, standards, limitations of their creators.
    * Ex: Maps of countries today, borders change all the time, do not necessarily reflect the "will of the people" or natural geographic boundaries.
    * consider: What was the cartographer trying to achieve? How does/did this influence the map?
* Error: we think maps and reality are related and if they are not => we can alter reality to make them fit.

"In general, when building statistical models, we must not forget that the aim is to understand something about the real world. Or predict, choose an action, make a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always about the real world, not an abstract mathematical world: our models are not the reality." - David Hand

## Conclusion
* Maps are valuable tools for human society, to pass on knowledge.
* We must always be aware the limits of our models, maps, abstractions.
* Maps/Models are:
    * reductions of something far more complex.
    * have elements of subjectivity.
    * created at a particular moment in time.
* We must use some model of the world in order to simplify and interact with it. (models are necessary)
* Problems:
    * Don't let maps prevent us from discovering new territory.
    * Updating our existing map.

### Model of Management
* Model: Break tasks down, have employees specialize and financially incentive workers to complete the tasks.
    * Model is no longer in use.
* What happened?
    * As more people understand the model, they may manipulate it.
    * As competitors understand the model better, they copy and adapt it, making it less effective, removing the advantage.
    * Model may be useful in one context (factory) but not in others as society changes (office, tech)
    * Human beings are not automatons; a more advanced model might have seek incentives beyond the monetary ones (status, knowledge, etc.) 

### Maps are necessarily Flawed
* Maps/Models are flawed, but these flaws are necessary.
* Lewis Caroll: a character created a map with a scale of 1 mile to 1 mile, such a map would not have the limitations of a map, but it also wouldn't be much help. You couldn't use it to go anywhere.
