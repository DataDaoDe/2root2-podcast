# Second-Order Thinking

* First order thinking => anticipating the direct results of your actions.
    * Fast and easy
* Second order thinking:
    * Deliberate and difficult
    * thinking about the results of the results
    * thinking about the entire branching tree of consequences (second and third order)
* Often second order effects aren't realized until its to late
    * "Law of Unintended Consequences"

## Examples: Law of Unintended Consequences

### Example 1: Cobras in Dehli under English Rule
* English rule in Delhi, English started paying money for Cobras b/c there was a Cobra problem.
* Paying for Cobras led to the Indian citizens breeding cobras and bringing them in for money.

### Example 2: Feeding Antibiotics to Livestock
* Makes meat safer and cheaper => consequence is that we created bacteria immune to anti-biotics.
* First order consequences:
    * Animals gain more weight => farmer increases his profits. (b/c they are sold by weight, need less food to bulk them up)
* Second order effects:
    * The bacteria that survive the continuous antibiotic exposure become antibiotic resistant.
    * Mass numbers of drug resistant bacteria are becoming part of our food chain.


## Impossibility of Doing just one thing
* Garett Hardin (ecologist), "You can never merely do one thing."
* We operate in a world where everything is interconnected, a web of connected but obscure and unpredictable relationships.
* Dense webs of connections can make actions have far reaching consequences.
* Things are not produced and consumed in a vacuum.
* John Muir (scottish-american naturalist, environmental philosopher) "When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe."

## What Second-Order Thinking is Not
* It is not a way to predict the future
* You can only predict consequences of what you know -> you are blind to all the unknowns
* Ex: could the consequences of feeding antibiotics to livestock have been predicted? Of paying for cobras in Dehli?

## What Second-Order Thiking teaches us
* To understand how the world really works we must included second and third order effects.
* We must be observant and honest about he web of connections we are operating in.

## Effective Application Areas
* Prioritizing long-term interests over short-term gains.
    * Ex: look over immediate gains (eating candy) to achieve long-term effects (better health).
        * first order: pleasure of sugar, second order: regular sugar consumption => overweight
    * Let's us ask: Will what I am doing now, give me the results I want?
    * Ex: Cleopatra of Egypt in 48 BC
        * ousted from the palace by her brother, Caesar invades chasing down Pompey.
        * The Romans were however extremely unpopular in Egypt.
        * Questions: should she work things out with her brother? Should get support from another country? Should she align herself with Caesar?
        * To please the Romans was to displease the Egyptians and vice-versa.
        * She chose to align herself with Caesar
            * first order: 
                * angered her brother, increased plotting to kill her, anger Egyptian people
                * started a civil war, with a siege of the palace where she and Caesar were trapped for several months.
            * second order: 
                * If she survived the short-term, she would have much more success & power with the support of Rome.
                * Caesar won the civil war and eliminated all opposition for Cleopatra.
* Constructing effective arguments.
    * Can help avert problems and anticipate challenges before they happen, so you can address them in advance.
    * Arguments are more persuasive when we demonstrate thinking through of the second order effects.
    * Mary Wollstonecraft -> argued for women's rights using second-order effects.
        * education would make women better wives and mothers => increased societal value

## Danger Zones with Second-Order Thinking
* Slippery slope effect, if we start with action A, everything after is a slope down to hell with a chain of consequences B, C, D, E, and F.
* Ex: Passing a law forbiding all vehicles to drive at a speed over 0 mph
* In practical life everything has limits.
* Ex: in the USA prohibition
    * Taking a first drink is a step toward a life of sin.
    * It is true that taking a drink might lead you to be an alcoholic, but not most of the time for most people.
* Ex: walking down the steps and dying
    * You can die by walking down the steps, this happens to people every year. Does this mean you should never walk down steps?
* Second-order thinking must analyze the most likely effects and their most likely consequences, if we worried about all possible effects we could never act or getting anything done.

## Conclusion & Tips
* consider the consequences, ask yourself: and then what?
* Think through time intervals: what about 10 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, 10 weeks, 10 years?
* Sketch out consequences in a branching tree

## Idea: Developing Trust
* Trust and Trustworthiness is the result of multiple interactions.
* Maximizing benefits is something that happens over time.
