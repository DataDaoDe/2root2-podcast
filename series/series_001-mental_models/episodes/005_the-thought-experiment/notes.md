# Thought Experiments

* devices of the imagination that can be used to investigate the nature of things.
* simulation run by the mind, where you can set and alter the parameters.
* abilities:
    * open new paths for inquiry / exploration
    * help us learn from mistakes / avoid new ones
    * take on the impossible
    * evaluate potential consequences of our actions
    * help figure out what we want and how best to reach our goals
* value:
    * we can do things we couldn't do in real life: ethics, physics, history, future.
* method:
    * not daydreaming
    * scientific method: ask question, do background research, formulate hypothesis, test, analyze outcomes, compare to hypothesis and adjust -> (redo)

## Types
1. Prefactual - speculate on future outcomes given present parameters. What will happen given A, B and C?
    - ex: given the state of current AI, will we have androids in 10 years?
2. Counter-Factual - speculate on outcomes of a past event, altering past parameters. What if X had happened instead of Y?
    - ex: What if JFK had not been assassinated?
3. Semi-Factual - how might have things remained unchanged given different A, B and C in the past?
    - ex: How could have the civil rights movement outcomes been the same even if MLK had not existed? 

## Ex 1: Lebron James vs Woody Allen
* main value: no limit to number of times experiment can be run or a variable changed.
* Of 100k games how many would Woody Allen win?

## Areas where Thought Experiments are Tremendously Useful
1. Imagining Physical Impossibilities
2. Re-imagining History
3. Intuiting the Non-Intuitive

### Physical Impossibilities
* Einstein elevator, no difference b/t accelerating in space or being pulled downward by force of gravity.
* led to formulation of general theory of relativity - universal theory of gravity.
* We can remove entire variables: (ignore cost, ignore time or space constraints)

### Re-Imagining History
* If Y had happened instead of X, what would the outcome have been? (counter-factuals)
* Difficult/dangerous b/c you need to know the probabilities.
* Ex: thing a led to X which failed, if we had done b then X would not have happened - often too naive.
* History events are one realization of a historical process. Like a deck of cards delt once. Like Poker, knowing the probabilities lets you know how likely particular outcomes are.
* History, like weather is a chaotic system. We can't predict the weather b/c ismall changes propagate in feedback loops and create large differences in outcome.
* We can never draw a definitive answer. We can understand the most likely effects of a given decision.


### Intuiting the Non-Intuitive
* The "veil of ignorance" proposed by John Rawls when designing laws for our society.
* Think of a company, its HR policy.
