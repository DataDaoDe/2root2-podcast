# The Map is not the Territory


* A map can also be thought of as a model of something, of reality.
* The map of reality is not reality. Maps are imperfect, reductions of what they represent.
* If a map perfectly represented the territory it would no longer be useful, it would be too complex.
* Map's usefulness == its reduction
* A Map can be a snapshot in time, something which no longer exist.
* GOAL: distill complexity into something simple.


## Examples of Maps
* Navigating from one city to another.
    * How far away are things?
    * What is along my trajectory? (gas, food, landmarks/sights)
* The financial statements of a company => how is the company performing in the market?
* An appliance manual => how the appliance works? How to fix and resolve issues problems?

## Usefulness
* Maps/Models are flawed, but this is no excuse to ignore them, why?
    * They are useful, useful to the extent that they can:
        * explain i.e. aid in understanding
        * predict
        * give new previously unknown insights
        * increase effeciency / decrease errors towards achieving defined goals (relevant to the map)

## Origin: Alfred Korzybski
* Phrase and Paper coined by Korzybski in 1931.
* [Summary of Paper](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/the-map-is-not-the-territory)
* London underground map => useful to travelers, train drivers don't use it.
    * 1. Maps/Models describe a territory but in a useful way w/a specific purpose.
    * 2. The ideal map would contain the map of the map, recursively, self-reflexivity
        * Ex: guide to paris, guide to the guide to paris, etc. (You would have answers to all problems, but complexity would become overwhelming)
    * Key points:
        * Altering the map does not change the territory. 
            * If you change what you believe about an object, patterns of neurons will change but not the object.
            * Ex: you can believe gravity doesn't exists or that you can fly. You will still not be able to fly though.
        * The map is a separate object from the territory AND exists as an object inside the territory.
            * Ex: we cause things to happen which cause other things AND things have caused us, even sometimes the things we cause (in feedback loops).
    * Associated Fallacy: [Mind Projection Fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/mind-projection-fallacy)
        * Projecting properties of your own mind onto the external world.
        * Ex:
            * when I look at a rock, I do not experience the rock only my minds representation of the rock.
            * Sugar is not inherently sweet, it only has chemical properties, which the brain interprets / represents as sweet.
        
* We can only navigate the complexity of reality through abstraction.
* Ex News: 
    * we read news. Journalists have consumed vast amounts of info, reflected on it, drawn abstractions and conclusions.
    * a lot is lost in the process.
    * its hard to see when the map no longer agrees w/the territory.

* We can forget the territory contains details the map doesn't describe.
* Problem: mistaking the map for reality => we think we have all the answers.
    * We create static rules and forget we live in a constantly changing world.
    * ignoring feedback loops => not seeing when the terrain has changed + reducing our ability to adapt to a changing environment.
* Maps as dogma => maps/models are not meant to be static references, the world is dynamic and constantly changing.
* Map/Models value = ability to predict/explain.
    * Therefore, as reality changes map/model must change to reflect reality.
    * Ex: Newtonian Physics worked until Einstein with special realitivity in 1905 produced a more accurate model.
    * Physicists delimit what Newton's and Einstein's models can explain/predict.
    * When they hit uncharted territory they don't assume the models work but proceede carefully.
* Problem: Risks of the territory not being shown on the map.
    * We must know the limitations, what it does and what it does not tell us. If we don't, danger lurks.

## Tragedy of the Commons
* What is common to many is taken less care of, for all men have greater regard for what is their own than for what they possess in common with others - Aristotle.
* A shared resource can be destroyed through bad incentives.
* Parable: why common resources get used more than is desireable from the standpoint of society as a whole.
* Garrett Hardin wrote extensively about the concept. [Article](https://pages.mtu.edu/~asmayer/rural_sustain/governance/Hardin%201968.pdf)
* Idea: Herdsman on public pastures.
    * Utility of adding one animal:
        * positive: sale of additional animal, say +1 in utility
        * negative: overgrazing of land, effects shared by all heardsmen, therefore utility is a fraction of -1, say (-1/10) if there are ten herdsmen.
        * The rational herdsman concludes he should add another animal, and another, and another.
        * Every heardsman reaches the same conclusion, increases heard w/out limit.
        * Resources are limited => ruin and doom comes, freedom in commons brings ruin to all.

### Issues
* Problem 1: We could assume that if the territory matches the map/model in some respects it matches in all respects.
* Ex: maybe emperically the shared resource is not destroyed and people behave differently.
* Problem 2: We could think adherence to map is more important than taking in new information about the territory.
* Maps are tools for thinking, not doctrines to force conformity, guidebooks not laws.

* George Box: All models are wrong, the practical question is: how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.
