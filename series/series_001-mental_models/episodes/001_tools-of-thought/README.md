# Mental Tools and Models, Tools for better Thought

## Wisdom

* Blind-spot minimization, person with fewest blindspots can make best decisions.
* Decisions based on improved understanding will generally be better than those based on ignorance

## Understanding Reality
* Break it down into parts, reveal interconnections
* We need multiple perspectives for complicated problems
* Most problems are multidimensional and having more tools, lenses, perspectives will help

## Barriers to Understanding
* Yourself
* We can't see what we aren't looking for, we don't notice things
* Failures to update our understanding:
    * Not having the right lense, perspective or viewpoint.
    * ego-induced denial
    * Too much distance from the consequences of our actions/decisions

### Flaw 1: Wrong Perspective
* Its hard to see a system we are in.
    * ex: A ball falling inside a freight train, vs. someone standing beside the train looking in w/X-Ray vision.
* There are limits to our own perception.
* Remedies:
    * Ask someone else outside the system for their opinion.

### Flaw 2: Ego
* Too much invested, identity, life meaning, etc. in an opinion - so we can't change it, regardless of feedback.
* If we express our ideas and they are criticized, we buckle down and defend instead of upgrading.
* Remedies:
    * Do not identify with your tools, beliefs, etc.
    * If you find yourself "wanting" something to be true or "feeling good" when something is true or "feeling bad" when presented some information, these are all clues that your ego is getting in the way.

### Flaw 3: Distance
* The further we are away from the consequences of our decisions, the easier it is to convince ourselves we are right.
* With distance, we can avoid the pain and challenge of updating our views.
* Remedies:
    * Put your money where your mouth is: Bet or stake actual money.
    * Make commitments based on your beliefs and opinions, and decisions.
    * Make predictions about the future, put your name on it, make sure they can be tested.

## On Updating Ourselves
* Confucius: "A man who commits a mistake and doesn't correct it, is committing another mistake."
* Often we simply don't even notice.
    * Ask: Why things happened?
    * Look actively for things which escape the attention.
    * Ask other people why they think things happened.

## Understanding Reality and Updating ourselves - the Interplay
* Only useful when we update our actions/behavior accordingly.
* We can use our improved understanding to effect positive change.
* Ex:
    * What good is it to know you interrupt people, if you never change the pattern?
    * People will say you just don't care. (The simplest story which fits the pattern)
* 2 Options:
    * You will understand and adapt to find success or you will fail.
    * We are afraid to learn and admit our mistakes, so we repeat mistakes and make suboptimal decisions.
* Often we think things just happen to us => passivity
    * Means we rarely reflect on our decisions and the outcomes.
* Problem:
    * We optimize for short-term ego protection (I am right!) vs. long-term happiness and error correction.
    * We shift to thinking in terms of black and white instead of shades of gray.
    * When X happens and it fits with our world view, we don't question, we think it is good for us and the world.
    * When X happens and it doesn't fit, it conflicts, the thing itself is wrong and bad.

## Example of a Thinking Tool: Gravity
* Gravity dimishes with distance, increases with mass (amount of stuff)
* Understand the movement of the earth about the sun
* Design of buildings and airplanes, launching of rockets
* As metaphor: Strong personality "pulling someone into their orbit"
* Most people can't explain gravity in great detail => it doesn't matter

## Example 2: Occam's Razor
* If we have competing theories, the simpler one, with fewer parameters should be preferred.
* If we have multiple hypotheses which predict the same thing, one should select the Hypothesis with the fewest assumptions.
* Reason: simpler theories tend to be more testable
    * Any wrong theory can be expanded with an ad-hoc hypothesis.

## Types of Mental & Thinking Tools / Models
* Some are too limited in scope (very specific)
* Some are unreliable (haven't been tested or challenged enough)
* Some are just wrong
* Goal: find reliable and useful thinking tools
* Better tools/models mean better thinking, fewer errors, improved actions, better decisions.
* Bad Model Ex:
    * Blood letting (caused unnecessary death by weakening sick patients even further)
* Testing Models:
    * Look at the results of model/tool application over the largest sample size possible.
    * Then we can see does this align with how the world actually works.

## Potential Problems:
* For any problem we use the tools we have, but are these tools the right ones for the job?
* An engineer thinks in terms of systems, a programmer in terms of computation/algorithms/complexity, economists - opportunity costs, psychologists - incentives, etc.
* Adage: "To a man with only a hammer, everything starts looking like a nail."
* The world is not so simple

## Removing Blind Spots
* Think through the problem using different lenses, perspectives, tools.
* Ex: Forest
    * Botanist: Ecosystem
    * Environmentalist: Climate Change
    * Businessman: Value of the Land
* Metaphor:
    * Blindmen and the Elephant: (Nose - Snake?, Tusk - Spear?, Ear - Fan?, Side - Wall?, Tail - Rope?)
* All facts:
    * Must be connected by a latticework of theory
    * One must know how the different tools relate to one another.
* World:
    * Is continuous, chaos, not isolated into discrete disciplines.
    * We must see the connections b/t fields to understand the whole.
* W/out the latticework nothing makes any sense.
* We want tools that do the most work per unit of thought energy.
    * Relate what you read/study to your structure of ideas.
* No Model / Tool contains the entire truth.
    * We must understand how they relate and how they are useful.

## Tips:
* Use a model, apply it, record and reflect on the results
* Journaling, notice success and failure, feedback loops
